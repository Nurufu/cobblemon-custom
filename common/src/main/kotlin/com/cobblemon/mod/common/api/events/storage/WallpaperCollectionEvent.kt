/**
 * Event being fired whenever the client connects to a server and "requests" what wallpapers are available for it to choose from.
 * Mods can listen to this event and remove available options from the client when they connect, essentially causing them to not exist client-side
 *
 * NOTE: Adding wallpapers here that do not exist on the client, will result in the purple/black fallback texture being displayed client-side.
